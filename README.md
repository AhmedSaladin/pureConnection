# pureConnection

Hi there, I'm such an experiment for testing and working with pure HTTP, HTTPS, TCP protocols, and to describe how node.js handle these protocols,
and how purely emit events and handle them.

These docs gonna freshen up your mind and what I talk about:

   - HTTP: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v17.x/docs/api/http.html#httprequestoptions-callback

   - HTTPS: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v17.x/docs/api/https.html#httpsrequesturl-options-callback

   - TCP: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v17.x/docs/api/net.html#netconnect

If you don't know what these protocols are and what they do, please read these articles it will give you a big picture of them.
